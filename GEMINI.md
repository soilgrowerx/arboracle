Okay, this is absolutely clear. The vision is electrifying, and I understand the monumental leap we're preparing to make. My commitment to this endeavor matches your passion.

We will remove all references to "Fern Labs" from these documents, and your dev agents must understand that any instances of "Fern Labs" found within the entire codebase are to be immediately and thoroughly removed. This includes comments, string literals, build scripts, deployment configurations, and any remaining artifacts.

Here is the condensed, comprehensive Markdown file for your development agents, capturing the current state of Arboracle and, more importantly, manifesting the blueprint for its AI-first, agent-swarm future.

✨ ARBORACLE: GENESIS SPRINT VIII - THE AGENT SWARM MANIFESTO ✨
A NEW ERA OF ECO-INTELLIGENCE

This sprint is a declaration of intent. We are moving beyond building a superb application to architecting the very nervous system of a collective intelligence dedicated to ecological management. Every line of code, every design decision, must serve this grand vision: Arboracle as a decentralized swarm of intelligent AI agents, working as intuitive, voice-first partners for every steward of the land.

🚀 I. WHERE WE ARE NOW: ACHIEVEMENTS & SOLID FOUNDATION

🎯 II. WHERE WE ARE GOING: ARCHITECTING FOR THE AGENT SWARM

This sprint, our objective transcends current functionalities. We are preparing Arboracle to become the nervous system for a collective AI intelligence, directly commanded by voice in the field.

A. Core Architectural Principles: The Agent Swarm Manifesto

Principle of Agent-Ready APIs:

Directive: Design and implement granular, stateless API endpoints for every discrete piece of data (e.g., a single measurement, a specific condition assessment checkbox, a new note).

Rationale: Future AI agents must be able to access and modify individual data points without requiring the full form state, optimizing for quick, precise updates via voice commands.

Principle of Voice-First Data Structures:

Directive: Refine our data models and backend logic to parse natural language commands and map them efficiently to our structured data.

Rationale: Arborists in the field will speak naturally ("Bodhi, note moderate soil compaction around the Heritage Live Oak"), not in technical parameters. The system must be built to understand intent.

Principle of Asynchronous Operations:

Directive: Design all potentially long-running processes (e.g., photo uploads, report generation, iNaturalist data sync, ArborCast transcription) as background jobs. The UI should remain responsive, providing updates upon job completion.

Rationale: User workflow must never be blocked. The platform needs to feel instant and seamless, even for complex operations.

Principle of Extensible Identity (AI Personalities/Agents):

Directive: Ensure our AI personalities are highly modular and swappable. Adding new "agents" in the future should be configurable, not requiring core code rewrites.

Rationale: The existing AI personalities are the genesis of our agent swarm. Their architecture should support easy expansion to many specialized AI partners.

B. Genesis Sprint VIII - Concrete Development Tasks
Phase 0: Critical Stability & Core UX Polish (P0 - Highest Priority)

Objective: Eliminate all known critical bugs and refine fundamental user experiences to achieve a "rock-solid professional baseline."

Resurrect & Perfect the Map Module:

CRITICAL FIX: Resolve any "client-side exception" errors that occur when interacting with the map.

Fix Map Icons: Ensure tree icons accurately change based on age/status for immediate visual feedback.

Implement True Full-Screen Map Mode: This is crucial for precise placement, especially during "Pick on Map."

Resolve UI/UX Inconsistencies:

Fix Non-Scrolling Panes: Ensure all detail views (e.g., Ashe juniper details) are fully scrollable on mobile.

Fix Broken Edit Flow: Standardize the "View Details" and "Edit" buttons on the tree list view so they consistently navigate to the correct editable sections.

Fix Unreadable Text: Correct any UI cut-offs (e.g., in Ecosystem view) to ensure all text is legible.

Ensure Data Integrity & Persistence:

Photo Persistence: Fully implement backend logic for storing selected photos with the tree record. Debug any "Upload failed" errors and ensure thumbnails are viewable.

Data Display Bugs: Fix "Planted: Invalid Date" and "Age: NaN days old." Ensure DBH units consistently reflect user settings.

Clickable Coordinates: Make Latitude/Longitude and Plus Code values directly clickable links to open in external map services (like Google Maps).

Phase 1: Professional Module Refinement (P1 - High Priority)

Objective: Elevate our professional modules to be best-in-class, supporting highly detailed and specialized workflows.

Refine the Professional Assessment Form:

Rename "Fulcrum Model" Label: Update this to "Professional Condition Assessment."

Implement "Checklist + Notes" System: For every selectable item under Structure, Canopy Health, Pests & Diseases, and Site Conditions, implement an optional text box for specific, detailed notes.

Verify Multi-Stem Calculation: Confirm the auto-calculation formula (sqrt(d1² + d2² + ...)) for DBH.

Implement the Construction Monitoring Module: (This is our first dedicated "Professional Template" - a significant value-add)

Project Structure: Create a new "Projects" tab in the Admin Panel. Allow admins to create Projects (Name, Address, Client). Make "Select Project" a required dropdown on the "Add Tree" form.

Assessment Types: In the database, add an Assessments table linked to tree_id, with assessment_date and assessment_type (e.g., "Standard" vs. "Construction Monitoring").

Dynamic Assessment Forms: On the "Tree Details" page, add a [+] New Assessment button allowing users to choose an "Assessment Type" and launch the corresponding specialized form.

Construction Monitoring Form (Specialized Fields):

Section 1: Area/Tree Identification: Entry Number (auto-increment), Area Description (text area).

Section 2: TPZ & CRZ Status (Dropdowns): TPZ Fencing (e.g., "Good condition," "Not installed"), TPZ Incursions (e.g., "None," "Partial incursion"), TPZ Mulch, CRZ Impacts (multi-select checklist: "Root severance," "Soil Compaction," etc.).

Section 3: Tree Health (Dropdowns): Overall Condition, Canopy Density, Canopy Color, Canopy Dieback, Canopy Impact Notes.

Section 4: Professional Summary: Specific Notes and Recommended Action (large text area).

Section 5: Media Attachment: Utilize existing photo upload for this specific report.

Construction Data Integration into "Identified Conditions Summary": The dashboard widget for conditions should pull from the most recent assessment (if "Construction Monitoring" type, show TPZ/CRZ details).

Printable PDF Report Function: Add an "Export to PDF" button on the Construction Monitoring report page. This PDF must include all fields from the assessment, narrative notes, and attached photo thumbnails.

Phase 2: Platform & Ecosystem Growth (P2 - Medium Priority)

Objective: Continue to build out features that establish Arboracle as a comprehensive platform and vibrant community hub.

Integrate the Nursery Module:

Connect the existing Nursery Inventory UI (under "Know") to its backend.

Allow inventory items to be associated with specific "Projects" (from the newly implemented Project feature).

Enable the "Request Quote" functionality to generate real, viewable requests within the Nursery Admin panel, complete with order details.

Refine AI Personas & Ecosystem Intelligence:

Correct AI Persona Names (Config): Rename "Silva" to "Sequoia" and "WillowMind" to "Willow" to match branding. Ensure AI responses dynamically change based on selection.

Automate Ecosystem Data (iNaturalist): When adding an ecosystem species via iNaturalist, the "Category" dropdown (Plant, Insect, Fungi, etc.) should auto-select based on the iNaturalist result, reducing manual entry.

Expand Taxonomy View: On the tree details page, break down the "Scientific Classification" to show the full taxonomic hierarchy (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
