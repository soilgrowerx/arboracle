# Arboracle: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 2.0 (Agent Swarm Edition)  
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Status:** MASTER DOCUMENT - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

## 1. The Vision & Guiding Philosophy

### 1.1. Our Manifesto: The Future of Eco-Intelligence
Arboracle is not just another app. It is the nervous system for a new era of ecological stewardship. Its destiny is to become a decentralized swarm of intelligent AI agentsâ€”a true partner for every professional managing our planet's green spaces. Every feature we build, every line of code we write, must serve this singular vision. The future of Arboracle is voice-first, AI-driven, and seamlessly integrated into the workflows of those on the ground.

### 1.2. The Design Ethos: Nature-Aligned Wisdom
We reject sterile, rigid interfaces. Our aesthetic must be **"super smooth and full of nature-aligned wisdom."**

*   **Organic & Fluid:** Embrace gentle curves, soft gradients, and flowing transitions. Elements should feel naturally "grown," not constructed.
*   **Sophisticated & Trustworthy:** Use a muted, earthy color palette (sage, moss, terracotta accents) and clean, professional typography. The UI must inspire confidence.
*   **Subtle Dynamism:** Incorporate micro-animations that mimic natural phenomena (gentle sways, soft blooms, ripples). Feedback should be felt, not just seen.

### 1.3. The Product Principle: A Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)
We build beyond viability. Arboracle must be **lovable**. This means it delivers:

*   **Emotional Connection:** A beautiful design and intuitive workflows that professionals are proud to use.
*   **Immediate Value:** Day-one utility that makes an arborist's job easier, faster, and more accurate.
*   **Aspirational Quality:** It represents the future of the industry, making users feel they are part of a movement.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

1.  **The Professional Field Arborist:** Manages urban and commercial trees. Needs fast, accurate, field-ready tools. Values efficiency, standardized data, and professional reporting.
2.  **The Construction Site Monitor:** A specialized arborist overseeing tree preservation on development sites. Requires structured, repeatable checklists for compliance reporting (e.g., TPZ/CRZ status).
3.  **The Forestry Student / Certification Candidate:** Studying to become a certified arborist. Needs an integrated platform that connects academic knowledge with real-world application.
4.  **The Nursery Owner:** Manages tree inventory and supplies stock for large-scale projects. Needs inventory management tools and a direct sales/quoting channel to forestry professionals.

## 3. The Grand Architecture: Agent-First & Asynchronous

Every implementation detail must align with our future as an agent swarm.

| Principle                    | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent-Ready APIs**         | Every discrete data point (e.g., a single DBH value, a TPZ Fencing status) must be accessible and modifiable via a granular, stateless API endpoint. Design for atomic updates.             |
| **Voice-First Data**         | Backend services must be architected to parse natural language intent (e.g., "Note minor root severance on the heritage oak") and map it to our structured database schema.               |
| **Asynchronous Operations**  | All long-running tasks (report generation, photo uploads, data syncs) MUST be background jobs. The UI must remain responsive and update upon completion without blocking the user.      |
| **Extensible AI Identity**   | AI Personalities (Bodhi, Sequoia, etc.) must be modular, swappable components. Adding a new agent should be a configuration change, not a code change.                                  |

## 4. Functional Requirements: The Platform Blueprint

### 4.1. Core Application & Dashboard
*   **User Story:** As a professional, I want to log in to a clean, branded dashboard that gives me an immediate, high-level overview of my inventory and a clear path to my most common tasks.

        *   **Professional Condition Assessment (Clickable Accordion):**
            *   Each section (Structure, Canopy Health, Pests & Diseases, Site Conditions) must be a collapsible accordion.
            *   Inside each section, every item (e.g., "Co-dominant stems," "Leaf discoloration") is a **checklist item**.
            *   **Crucially**, when an item is checked, an optional `Add specific notes...` text field appears directly beneath it.
            *   **The "Fulcrum Model" label must be removed.**
        *   `"Willow Knows" AI Insights`: This card displays dynamic, context-aware information based on the selected assessment items. (e.g., if "Soil Compaction" is checked, it displays info on root growth limitation and links to a knowledge base article).
        *   `Management Actions`: Comma-separated text input.
    5.  **Media Upload:**
        *   **CRITICAL FIX:** Ensure the `[Camera]` and `[Gallery]` buttons successfully upload images. Uploaded images must appear as thumbnails within the form and be persistently saved with the tree record upon saving. Resolve the "Upload failed" error.

### 4.4. Interactive Map View

    2.  **Controls:** Implement functional UI controls for `Zoom In/Out`, `Toggle Satellite/Street View`, and `Find My Location`.
    3.  **Markers:** Tree locations must be represented by **dynamic icons** that change based on age (sprout -> sapling -> mature tree).
    4.  **Interactivity:** Clicking a marker must open a clean pop-up with key tree details and a link to the full "Detail View."
    5.  **Future-Proof for Overlays:** The architecture must support the addition of analytical data layers (e.g., from SkyFi API).

### 4.5. Specialized Professional Module: Construction Monitoring
*   **User Story:** As a construction site arborist, I need a dedicated form template for my specific, recurring monitoring tasks, and I want to organize all these reports under a single 'Project'.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **"Projects" Feature:** Must be creatable in the Admin Panel. Each project will have a name, address, and client.
    2.  **"Assessment Types":** When adding a new assessment to a tree, the user must choose between `Standard` and `Construction Monitoring`.
    3.  **Dedicated Form Template:** The "Construction Monitoring" form will include specialized, dropdown-heavy fields:
        *   `TPZ Fencing`: Options like "Good condition," "Not installed," etc.
        *   `TPZ Incursions`: Options like "None," "Excessive," etc.
        *   `CRZ Impacts`: A multi-select checklist for `Root severance`, `Soil Compaction`, etc.
        *   And all other fields as specified in the "Sprint VII" brief.
    4.  **Printable PDF Reports:** An "Export to PDF" function must generate a professional, client-ready report from a specific Construction Monitoring assessment, including all selected options, narrative notes, and photo thumbnails.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
