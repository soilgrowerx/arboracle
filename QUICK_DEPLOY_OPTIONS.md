**Steps:**
1. Push your current changes to GitHub
2. Open Codespaces from your repo
3. Run `npm run dev` 
4. Get a public URL to test
5. If happy, deploy to Vercel for production

## 🔑 AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
Add this environment variable in your chosen platform:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```
