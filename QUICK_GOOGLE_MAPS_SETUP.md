# 🗺️ Quick Google Maps Setup for Arboracle

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: Google Maps is Already Implemented!

Arboracle already has complete Google Maps integration. You just need to add your API key!

## 🚀 Quick 3-Step Setup:

### Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key (5 minutes)

2. Create project (or use existing)
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API  
   - Geocoding API
4. Create API Key in "Credentials"
5. Copy your key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your Deployment

#### For Vercel:
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### For GitHub Codespaces:
```bash
# In your Codespace terminal:
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env.local
npm run dev
```

#### For Netlify:
```bash
# In Netlify dashboard > Site settings > Environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Test Your Maps! 🎉
1. Deploy/run your app
2. Go to `/map` page
3. See interactive tree map!
4. Test "Add Tree" > "Pick on Map"

## 🌟 What You'll Get:
