Once the E layer is reached a noticeable lack\nof organic material is present.\n\nThe answer is (A)\n\nSolution 203\n\nThe infiltration rate is a measure of how quickly water drains through soil. This is determined by\nthe pore space which is a function of the size of the soil particles and the level of compaction. A\nsoil with larger particles such as sand will have larger pore spaces and allow water to drain\nmore freely. This is the opposite with clay since it has fine particles. Also, the higher the level of\ncompaction, the smaller the pore space and therefore the lower the infiltration rate. The\ncombination of the large particles and low compaction would indicate loose sand as having a\nhigh infiltration rate\n\nThe answer is (A)\n\nSolution 204\n\nSubstances may be used to adjust the PH of soil if it is not at an appropriate level.

Soils will\nhave both negatively and positively charged sites but the negative outnumber the positive and\ntherefore the soil charge is a net negative.\n\nThe answer is (A)\n\nSolution 207\n\nIn this soil structure, it is simulating a separation of clay which is denser than the lower layer of\nsand. The clay will retain its water to the point until it is completely saturated, and water will\nthen begin to flow to the layer below. This is due to clay having a higher water-holding capacity\nfrom an inclusion of a high percentage of micropores.\n\nThe answer is (C)\n\nSolution 208\n\nThe voids between soil particles allow for water to occupy the space. When water fills the\nentirety of the micro and macropores, this is called saturation.

If the ratio is 10-6-4, this means the amount of\nnitrogen is 10% per bag. Therefore, for each 10-lb bag the amount of nitrogen is 0.1 x 10 = 1 lb.\nper bag. The necessary rate is 4 lbs. per 1000 square feet. This means it will take 4 bags to cover\nthe 4 lbs. for every 1000 square feet. Then to cover the 2500 total area we can calculate the\nnumber of bags needed:\n\n                                         2500 -\n                          #     +     = ,               . / 4 = 10\n                                         1000 -\n\nThe answer is (D)\n\n\nSolution 226\n\nWhen performing an analysis of a tree\u2019s condition, there are two types: soil and foliar.
