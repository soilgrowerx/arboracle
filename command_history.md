    *   **Context:** Used to resolve a `Type error: Cannot find type definition file for 'unist'` during the build process.
*   **`npm install --save-dev @types/mdast @types/remark`**
    *   **Purpose:** Attempted to install TypeScript type definitions for `mdast` and `remark`.
    *   **Context:** This command failed, indicating that `@types/remark` might not exist or was not found in the registry.
